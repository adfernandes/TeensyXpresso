# TeensyXpresso
Create Teensy 4.1 projects from MCUXpresso IDE

Creating a Teensy 4.1 program with MCUXpresso is quite simple. Just start with a RT1060-Evalutation-Kit project, make some pin changes and create a hexfile output. Download the hexfile with the teensy loader. The iLed-blinky example works out of the box.
