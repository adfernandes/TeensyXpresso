# Teensy 4.1 Web Server Demo

This Teensy 4.1 web server demo was created with MCUXpresso IDE. It's based on the evbkmimxrt1060-SDK  lwip demo project.
Only some changes had to be made due to the different ethernet phys.
There are two optional configurations available one for uart console at pin 24 (TX) and 25 (RX) and another for a vcom console over usb.
